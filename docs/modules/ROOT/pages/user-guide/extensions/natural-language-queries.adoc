= Natural Language Queries
Natural Language Queries feature allows users to interact with NeoDash using natural language to generate Cypher queries for querying Neo4j graph databases. 
This integration leverages Language Models (LLMs) to interpret user inputs and generate Cypher queries based on the provided schema definition.

== Configuration
To enable Natural Language Queries in NeoDash, follow these configuration steps:

1. Open NeoDash and navigate to the "Extensions" section in the left sidebar.
2. Locate the "Natural Language Queries" extension and click on it to activate it.
3. Once activated, a new button will appear in the sidebar. Click on the button to open the configuration window.
4. In the configuration window, you will be prompted to provide the necessary information to connect to the Language Model (LLM). Enter the model provider, API key, and select the desired model to use.
5. After providing the required information, click on the "Start Querying" button to finalize the configuration.


== Usage
Once the Natural Language Queries extension is configured, you can start using it in your NeoDash reports. Here's how:

1. Open the Report settings for the desired report.
2. In the report settings, you will find a toggle switch located above the editor. This switch allows you to toggle between Cypher and English languages.
3. Since you have enabled the extension and authenticated by providing your API key, you can switch to the English language mode.
4. Start formulating your queries in plain English, using natural language expressions to describe the data you want to retrieve.
5. Once you have composed your query, click the "Submit" button to generate and execute the corresponding Cypher query.



== Prompting Tips

When using Natural Language Queries in NeoDash, keep the following tips in mind to enhance your experience:

1. Be clear and specific in your queries: Provide detailed descriptions of the data you want to retrieve, including node labels, relationship types, and property values.
2. Use keywords and phrases: Incorporate relevant keywords and phrases that are commonly used in the context of your data to improve query accuracy.
3. Ask precise questions: Frame your queries as questions to obtain specific information. For example, instead of "Show me all customers," try "Which customers have made a purchase in the last month?"
4. Experiment with different phrasings: If you're not getting the desired results, try rephrasing your query using synonyms or alternative expressions.
5. Avoid ambiguous queries: Ambiguous or vague queries may yield unexpected results. Make sure to provide sufficient context and clarify any ambiguities.
6. Validate and review generated queries: Always review the generated Cypher queries to ensure they accurately represent your intent and produce the expected results.


== Important Considerations

When using Natural Language Queries with Language Models, it's important to be aware of the following considerations:

1. Multiple model providers: Depending on your configuration, your queries may be processed by different model providers. Take into account that this means your data is being sent to different providers.
2. Non-deterministic nature: Language Models can produce non-deterministic outputs. The generated queries may vary between different runs, even with the same input prompt. Validate the generated queries and perform thorough testing to ensure correctness.
3. Potential hallucination: Language Models can generate outputs that may not align with the specific schema or data constraints. Exercise caution and verify the results to prevent potential inaccuracies or hallucinations.
